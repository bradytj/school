   - Ocean water
     - Acidic
     - Neutral
     - Alkaline
   - Near the equator
     - Cold
     - Warm
   - The aphotic limnetic zone of a lake
     - Dark
     - Sunlit
   - A river estuary
     - Fresh
     - Brackish
     - Salty
   - A river below a waterfall
     - High O<sub>2</sub>
     - Low O<sub>2</sub>
   - The middle of the ocean, far from land
     - High nutrients
     - Low nutrients
   - An oligotrophic lake
     - High turbidity

2. Identify each of the following organisms as **phytoplankton, zooplankton, nekton, benthos,** or **decomposers.**

3. Compare each part of a river.
   - Oxygen Levels: high, moderate, low
   - Temperature: warm, moderate, cold
   - Nutrient Levels: high, moderate, low
   - Salinity: freshwater, saltwater, brackish

   |                     | Oxygen Levels | Temperature | Nutrient Levels | Salinity |
   | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------- | -------- |
   | **Source Zone**     |               |             |                 |          |
   | **Transition Zone** |               |             |                 |          |
   | **Mouth / Delta**   |               |             |                 |          |
