# Comparing treaties and executive agreements

## The Treaty Process

  1. Senate approves
     
     The treaty process begins when the President negotiates the terms of an agreement with two or more severeign states. The proposal is then submitted to the Senate for approval. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is needed before the treaty can be ratified.

  2. President ratifies
  
     After consent by the Senate, the President ratifies the treaty by giving formal notification of the terms to all sovereign states involved. This ratification process makes the treaty officially valid.

  3. Treaty becomes law

     Upon the ratification of the treaty, the provisions of the treaty are enforcable as law, unless deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. All sovereign states are legally accountable for the provisions within the treaty.

## The Executive Agreement Process

  1. President makes agreement

     The executive agreement process begins when the President negotiates a pact with the head of a foreign state, or his or her subordinates.
  
  2. Notifies senate

     Within sixty days of making the agreement the President notifies the Senate of its details. The agreement does not have to be approved by the Senate.

  3. Expires with term

     An executive agreement expires with the end of a President's term unless renewed by the incoming President. These agreement have the same legal standing as treaties, but they do not stand above federal laws or the Constitution
